# Editor dotfiles

I spend a lot of time in my editors; programming, writing, brainstorming, testing --
these dotfiles set them up.

+ **emacs:** my full-blown (and primary) development environment, running [evil-mode]. Emacs
  vs Vim? The answer is both.
+ **neovim:** my heavier-duty vim config, for systems I have more control over.
+ **vim:** same as neovim, but for vanilla vim
+ **vimlite:** a light, plugin-free config for systems I have no control over.
